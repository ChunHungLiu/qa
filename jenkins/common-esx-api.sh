# This is a stub file for now. It will contain all the common library routines
# that use various VMWare APIs to get something done on an ESX host.
# These calls will be used by the ESX test suite scripts, like
# run-single-host-suite-esx.sh or common-esx.sh for example.
# The equivalent XS file is common-xe.sh
