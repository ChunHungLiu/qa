QA is the repo for OpenStack and Olympus CI infrastructure

You will find the following directories:

- config: this backups the configuration for the CI Jenkins infrastructure. To
  back up use backup-configs.sh as jenkins@openstack-jenkins.uk.xensource.com,
  then unpack the resulting tarball into qa.hg/config, and commit your changes.
 
- scripts: this stores utility scripts that run on the CI Jenkins workers. If
  you make a change on any of these files on the field, please remember to 
  commit your changes otherwise they will be lost if a worker gets wiped out.

- jenkins: here's where the real deal is. You'll find several shell scripts
  named like run-*-test.sh. Those are  runner scripts for Jenkins jobs. You 
  should see one per job and you should see a 'mapping' directory with other
  files to make the test work.
  You'll find also:
  - sites: to update the configuration of our sites. Currently we have:
    - cambridge
    - cambourne
    - santa-clara
    - redmond
    - bengaluru
    If you want variables to be exposed into Jenkins tests, this should be a 
    good place where to put them.
  - build: don't touch this, unless you know what you're doing. 
  - utils: for utility scripts and functions.
